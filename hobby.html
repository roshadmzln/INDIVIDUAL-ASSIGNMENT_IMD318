                <h3>Playing Badminton</h3>
                <p>I love to playing badminton with my friends or my family.Whenever I hit the court for a game of badminton, it's pure fun and relaxation. We gather at the local sports complex, rackets in hand, ready to smash and dash.
 It's not just about the exercise; it's the laughs, the friendly competition, and the rush of nailing a perfect drop shot or a powerful smash.</p>

                <h3>Baking</h3>
                <p>Baking is my escape and my joy, all rolled into one. There's something magical about mixing simple ingredients like flour
, sugar, and eggs, then watching them transform into delicious treats. I love experimenting with new recipes, tweaking ingredients, and seeing how it all turns out. My mom's kitchen often smells like a bakery, with the scent of fresh bread, cookies, or cakes wafting through the air.
 I usually bake for friends and family, especially during the holidays or special occasions.</p>

                <h3>Watching Movie</h3>
                <p>Watching a movie is my favorite way to unwind. Whether I'm curling up on the couch with some popcorn or heading out to the cinema with friends, there's nothing like getting lost in a good film. I love everything from action-packed blockbusters to heartwarming dramas and mind-bending thrillers.
 It's the perfect escape from reality, a couple of hours where I can immerse myself in different worlds and stories. Plus, it's always fun to discuss the plot twists and characters with friends afterward.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>Photography allows me to capture the beauty of the world and convey stories through images. Whether I'm wandering through urban landscapes, trekking through nature, or simply catching spontaneous moments with friends, my camera is a constant companion. I enjoy playing with various angles, lighting, and compositions to create unique and expressive shots. It's more than just taking pictures,
 it's about viewing the world in a different light and sharing that vision with others..</p>
